Before getting started, make sure your development environment includes Node.js and an npm package manager. 
You can install Node.js here: https://nodejs.org/en/
I will be using the npm client command line interface (installed with Node.js by default) as my npm package mananger. 
To see if you have npm client installed, run "npm -v" in a terminal/console window. 

Install the Angular CLI: npm install -g @angular/cli 

Create a workspace and application: ng new <app-name> => ng new angular-tour-of-starcraft-players

Serve the application: cd app-name, ng serve --open or just ng serve --o => cd angular-tour-of-stacraft-players, ng serve --open 

--open / --o automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/
